# Cleanup Log

## Files Removed (Safe to remove):

1. **index.js** (root) - Redundant file that just requires app.js
2. **src/routes/v1/index.js** - Unused centralized router
3. **test-api.js** - Development testing file
4. **src/views/products/reviews_backup.ejs** - Backup file
5. **src/routes/debug.js** - Development-only debug routes

## Files Kept (Required):

- All individual route index.js files (src/routes/v1/*/index.js) - These combine API and render routes
- All controllers, models, views, services, middlewares
- All configuration files
- All upload directories and sample data

## Reasoning:

- Root index.js: package.json scripts point directly to app.js
- src/routes/v1/index.js: app.js imports individual route files, not this centralized router
- test-api.js: Development testing file not needed in production
- reviews_backup.ejs: Backup file, main reviews.ejs exists
- debug.js: Only used in development mode with NODE_ENV check
